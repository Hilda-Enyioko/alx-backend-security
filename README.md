# IP Tracking: Security and Analytics

---
## Overview

IP tracking is a critical technique for enhancing security, understanding user behavior, and maintaining legal compliance in web applications. In Django, this can be implemented via middleware, asynchronous tasks, and integrations with external services. This module explores how to log, blacklist, geolocate, and analyze IP addresses responsibly and efficiently.
